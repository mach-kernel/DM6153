## Game 1: "I gotta poop"

"Run home and avoid obstacles on your way to sweet relief, get home too late and poop your pants."

### Core Mechanic
- Running
- Jumping
- Racing against clock

### Stuff
- Modifiers/powerups that make you poop more or less
- Temptations: seeing advertisements for Miralax, or it starts raining and you now also really have to pee.
- Time wasters (coworkers, the police, your significant other, anything getting in the way of you and a toilet)
- High fidelity audio samples of farting. 

### Long form description
You always make poor decisions, springing for that extra spicy buffalo chicken sub at lunch every day. Refusing to change your ways, you must face the fact that every bathroom break is an emergency. You begin in your office, as you navigate around your coworkers avoiding small talk to run to the elevator and eventually your car. You cut through traffic as you drive to clear the stage on time, but have to walk a fine line of driving aggressively but not so much so that you would poop yourself. As you park, you run down the final sidewalk stretch avoiding any neighbors or obstacles, jumping over fences to get into your house, avoid everyone, and make it to the bathroom on time.

### Novelty
Poop sells.

### Questions hoping to answer

- What makes sense as a temptation/time waster/modifier?
- Do I provide enough entertainment past a 'time trial' game with functional sugar?
- Do people seem to be having fun past all the poop jokes/references?
- Can I make the player feel the agony of having to rush to the restroom (e.g am I immersive enough)?

### Things not tested
- Platforming motion (acceleration curves for running/jumping are easy to tweak and cosmetic)
